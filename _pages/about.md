Hello everyone, my name is Honghong Wang. I hold a Master’s degree from the Key Laboratory of Media Audio and Video under the Ministry of Education at the Communication University of China. I am currently a Speech Algorithm Researcher at Beijing Fosafer Information Technology Co., Ltd.

My research interests include speech emotion recognition, multimodal emotion recognition, speech classification, and speech synthesis. I have published several papers at prestigious conferences such as ICASSP, INTERSPEECH, and ISCSLP, and have earned top rankings in international emotion recognition competitions, including [MEIJU2025](https://ai-s2-lab.github.io/MEIJU2025-website/) and [IERP2024](http://www.iscslp2024.com/emotionChallenges).
