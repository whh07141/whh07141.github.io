Hello everyone, my name is Honghong Wang. I obtained my master's degree from the Key Laboratory of Media Audio and Video of the Ministry of Education at Communication University of China. I am currently working as a speech algorithm researcher at Fosafer Information. 

My research interests include speech emotion recognition, multimodal emotion recognition, speech classification and speech synthesis. I have published many papers in conferences such as ICASSP and ISCSLP, and have also won leading positions in international emotion recognition competitions such as MEIJU2025 and IERP2024.
